/**
*  Calculates the grade a student receives on an examination
*
*  The program first prompts the user to enter the number of points possible
*  on the exam.  Then, the program prompts for the number of items missed; if a positive
*  number is entered, the program responds by calculating and displaying the percentage
*  score out of 100.  If a negative number is entered, the program prints a "Thank You" message
*  and exits.
*  
*  A sample interaction might be: (user input marked with '>')
*  "Enter the number of items on the exam"
*  >25
*  "Enter the number of items missed"
*  >3.5
*  "Missing 3.5 results in a score of 86.0"
*  "Enter the number of items missed"
*  >0
*  "Missing 0 results in a score of 100.0"
*  "Enter the number of items missed"
*  >-100
*  "Thank you -- have a great day!"
*
